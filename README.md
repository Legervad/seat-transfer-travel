# NextBus
A new methodology in intercity transportation. 

### What is in it?
You will be able to travel even if it seems there is no available seat!

### But how?
Suppose you travel from Istanbul to Ankara, by a bus that goes through 3 stations: Istanbul, Eskisehir, and Ankara.

There are only 2 available seats, seat-1 and seat-2.

Ayse buys the seat-1 from Istanbul to Eskisehir, and Bengu buys the seat-2 from Eskisehir to Ankara.

And there is Cemre who wants to travel from Istanbul to Ankara. However, when she checks the system, there seems to be no seats available!

Through my methodology, Cemre will be able to travel from Istanbul to Eskisehir on seat-2 and on seat-1 from Eskisehir to Ankara!

Using a path finding algorithm, my project suggests all possible ways to travel from one station to another either the direct ones or via seat-transferring.
